# AMLS_assignment22_23
Assignment project for Applied Machine Learning Systems 22/23

This project is written in Python and uses a Jupyter notebook as the front-end for user-friendly selection of the task and model to be tested.

It expects the CelabA and Cartoon Set datasets, and corresponding test data sets, to be installed in the Datasets folder.

To run the front-end, open the file main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks or a similar environment. The following packages are used: Scikit-learn 1.02, NumPy 121.5, Matplotlib 3.5.1, OpenCV 4.6.0, TensorFlow 2.0.0

Now, can also run this code in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mparnell/main-ipynb

N.B. two minor changes had to be made to the code to run in Kaggle:
  1. change the location of the Datasets
  2. change the set_random_seed() function to account for the different version of TensorFlow
