Assignment project for Applied Machine Learning Systems 22/23

This project is written in Python and uses a Jupyter notebook as the front-end for user-friendly selection of the task and model to be tested.

It expects the CelabA and Cartoon Set datasets, and corresponding test data sets, to be installed in the Datasets folder.
